# ---------------------------------------------------------------
# Important Note on 32-bit macOS (i386) Builds
# ---------------------------------------------------------------
# Go 1.15 was the last version to support building 32-bit (i386) binaries for macOS.
# If you need to generate 32-bit binaries for older Intel Macs (2006â€“2010 era),
# you must use Go 1.15 or an earlier version.
#
# Starting from Go 1.16, support for 32-bit macOS was officially removed.
# Newer Go versions (1.16+) only compile 64-bit binaries for macOS.
#
# Reference: https://golang.org/doc/go1.16#darwin
#
# If you STILL need to generate 32-bit Intel binaries for macOS and have installed
# Go 1.15 (or earlier), you can attempt the following build command:
#
# GOOS=darwin  GOARCH=386 go build  -o $BINDIR/$BASENAME.mac32.intel zxtex.go
#
# However, this is completely unsupported and untested in modern Go versions.
# There are no guarantees that this will work.
